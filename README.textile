h1. SHiFT Conference 2010 Twitter Archive

h2. Instructions

* Maybe you should try rake gems:install because Mashie and HAML are required
* The DB is full of tweets at this point, so all you need to do is run the server to see the Twitter archive
* You can edit app/views/tweets/index.html.haml to customize the way information is displayed
* To make a static html file for the museum, simply save the page's source in your browser :)
* The full tweet object is accessible like this: Tweet.first.full_tweet['profile_image_url'] (hint hint)

* There's a static file already saved in public/archive_by_alex.html (but you might dislike the simplistic html)

h2. What code is there to see?

* If you want to look around, you'd see there's only one Model (Tweet) that was scaffolded. 
* The data was populated using the minimal script in db/seed.rb (and by running rake db:seed -- you run it anymore)
* A helper method was created to generate links for hashtags and @mentions
* index.html was removed, root route was directed to meets_controller
* guess that's it

h2. Have fun

Now get to work
