h1. SHiFT Conference 2010 Twitter Archive

h2. Instructions

* The DB is full of tweets at this point, so all you need to do in run the server to see the Tweet archive. 
* Maybe you should try rake gems:install because Mashie is required
* You can edit app/views/index.html.haml to customize how the view is generated. 
* To make a static html file, just save the source you're viewing in your browser :)

* There's a static file already saved in public/archive_by_alex.html (but you might dislike the simplistic html)

h2. What code is there to see?

* If you wanted to poke around, you'd see there's only one Model (Tweet) that was scaffolded. 
* The data was populated using the minimal script in db/seed.rb (and by running rake db:seed -- you shouldn't do this anymore)
* A helper method was created to generate links for hashtags and @mentions
* index.html was removed, root route was directed to meets_controller
* guess that's it

h2. Have fun

You read me.
